# React TDD LAB

This repo contains the starter propject for building a comments list by Test Driven Development (TDD).
It is following the instructions stated in this blog post [Creating Readable Tests Using React Testing](https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/creating-readable-tests-using-react-testing-library-2bd03c49c284)

## What does this repo contain
The sample repo is created using `create-react-app`

The initial libraries installed besides react, are

For testing:
- react-testing-library
- jest-dom
Note: We do not need to install `jest` as it is already installed by `create-react-app`

For development
- props-types (this an optional library for ensuring the correct type of props is passed to a component)

For styling:
- bootstrap (and imported in index.js)
